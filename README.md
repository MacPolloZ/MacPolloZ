- 👋 Hi, I’m @MacPolloZ
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, coding, music, cybersecurity, videogames and challenges
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things. I'm studying Computer Systems Engineer, but I'm also learning about cybersecurity, pentesting, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to solve all the problems we have in the computer world. It's an ambitious goal I know, but it will be amazing, even if I fail my errors
     could be useful, just like MULTICS.
